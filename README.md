**Team: Procastinators**  
AI Tinkerers â€“ New York City Hackathon (Building with Gemini CLI)  

---

## Problem Statement  
Right before exams, students often feel **overwhelmed by scattered notes, lecture slides, and textbooks**.  
They waste precious time organizing instead of focusing on actual learning.  

Our **Study_partner** solves this by turning messy study material into **structured knowledge points, quizzes, and progress reports**â€”all powered by **Gemini CLI** and a local-first workflow. Everything will be done in command lines. The only thing you need is an Gemini API.

---

## Features
- **Import**: Chunk long files into chunks. 
- **Summarization**: AI-generated knowledge points that highlight the most important details.  
- **Quiz Generator**: AI-generated practice quizzes targeting included knowledge points.  
- **Progress Reports**: AI-generated insights into whatâ€™s covered and whatâ€™s weak, also linking to the original slides.  
- **Self-defined Subjects**: Users can define their own subject focus.  
- **Local + Gemini**: Mixes local parsing with Geminiâ€™s advanced summarization and reasoning.

## Installation

### 1. Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/siyansw/study_partner.git
cd study_partner
```

## 2. Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
```

## 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root folder with:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyC-your-actual-api-key-here-dont-share-this 
DB_PATH=study.db
```

## Important:
Do not commit your actual key.
Add .env to .gitignore.
Use .env.example for sharing.

## Usage
Import your study materials:
```bash
python app.py import [file_path]
```
Turn them into knowledge points:
```bash
python app.py summarize
```

(Optional) If you want to see what knowledge points are summarized:
```bash
sqlite3 study.db
select * from knowledge_points;
```
Generate quiz questions:
```bash
python app.py quiz (optional: --kp-id [knowledge point id] --num [the number of questions you want Gemini to generate] )
```
Review your previous mistakes and identify the original source files where these topics are coveredï¼š
```bash
python app.py report
```

## (Add-on) MCP
Add procrastinator to your MCP serverï¼š
```bash
gemini mcp add procrastinator "mcp_server.py"
```

## Workflow Example
1. Place your lecture notes or text files into test_data/
2. Import files (parser.py) â†’ parse and chunk long files for further review.
3. Run summarization (kp_extractor.py) â†’ Gemini condenses your notes into structured knowledge points.
4. Generate quizzes (quizzer.py) â†’ Gemini generates practice questions and grades your quiz answers.
5. View reports in reports (report.py) â†’ progress and insights are saved locally.
6. (Optional) Add our app to your MCP server.

## Where Gemini CLI is Used
1. llm.py: Summarization of notes via Gemini CLI.
2. app.py: End-to-end pipeline orchestration using Gemini.
3. quizzer.py + report.py: Chain Gemini outputs into actionable quizzes/reports.
4. mcp_server.py: Manages and integrates MCP modules, acting as a server to coordinate data flow between components.
