## Problem Statement  
Right before exams, students often feel **overwhelmed by scattered notes, lecture slides, and textbooks**.  
They waste precious time organizing instead of focusing on actual learning.  

Our **Study_partner** solves this by turning messy study material into **concise summaries, key points, quizzes, and progress reports**â€”all powered by **Gemini CLI** and a local-first workflow.  

---

## Features
- **Summarization**: Condense large lecture notes into concise takeaways.  
- **Key Point Extraction**: Automatically highlight the most important details.  
- **Quiz Generator**: Create practice quizzes directly from notes.  
- **Progress Reports**: AI-generated insights into whatâ€™s covered and whatâ€™s weak.  
- **Self-defined Subjects**: Users can define their own subject focus.  
- **Local + Gemini**: Mixes local parsing with Geminiâ€™s advanced summarization and reasoning.
